A short description of your application.
Where To Next is like an online travel bucketlist. We provide a list of cities from around the world, and allow you, the user, to choose what activities, landmarks, and food you would visit on your dream trip! The site includes a hopefully enticing photo of the city of your choice as well as a map, where the user can click around and find what area they would like to visit, as well as businesses to visit and adventures you can take while on the trip.

A brief explanation of the technologies (Node modules, Express middleware etc) used.

A couple of paragraphs detailing the general approach you took.

Notes on any unsolved problems or major hurdles your team had to overcome.

Installation instructions for any dependencies.
