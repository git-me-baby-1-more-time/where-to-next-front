## What does it do?
Where To Next is an online travel bucketlist. We provide a list of cities from around the world, and allow you, the user, to choose what activities, landmarks, and food you would visit on your dream trips! The site includes an enticing photo of the cities as well as maps, where the user can explore and create an amazing bucket list of adventures to go on.

## What technology did we use?
HTML5, css, Bootstrap, Handlebars, Node, Express, Google Maps API, Javascript, Jquery

## How did we do it?!
We began by breaking the project down and figured out the different features we wanted to have. We ended up with a long list of ideas that we wanted to include, ended up shorting that list to just activies, landmarks, restaurants and comments. We knew we wanted to include a third party API, and settled with Google Maps, as we thought it would be very aesthetically pleasing as well as very helpful (not to mention cool) to have a working, interactive map where the user could scroll through the map and find things that interested them in that specific city. We decided on having a gallery for our landing page, we then picked a handful of cities to include in our location gallery.

The first few days of coding, we chose to work on the back end, and the authentication. We also did some of the front end HTML, to get a skeleton for our location gallery, nav bar, and authentication modals. We communicated regularly with what we were working on as well as when to commit, push, etc. so that we could make sure everyone was both on task and on time with their work. We built out much of the project by the start of the week, and spent a lot of time adjusting the small stuff to really make the features pop on the page.

On our last day of the project, we spent a lot of time on the Google Maps API, as well as making sure everything worked how we wanted, keeping an organized list of bugs and fixes we needed to reach our goals for the project. We had some reach goals, which we successfully reached, as well as cleaned up some code.

## What were our major hurdles?
Adding the Google Maps API was the most difficult part of our project, however, we were able to figure out how to get it to work perfeclty and it ended up being a really great addition to our site.
